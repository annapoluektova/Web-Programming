      A computer network, or simply a network, is a collection of computers and other hardware components interconnected 
      by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information.
      Where at least one process in one device is able to send/receive data to/from at least one process residing
      in a remote device, then the two devices are said to be in a network. Simply, more than one computer interconnected through
      a communication medium for information interchange is called a computer network.

      Networks may be classified according to a wide variety of characteristics, such as the medium used to transport the data,
      communications protocol used, scale, topology, and organizational scope.

      Communications protocols define the rules and data formats for exchanging information in a computer network, and provide
      the basis for network programming. Well-known communications protocols include two Ethernet, a hardware and link layer
	  standard that is ubiquitous in local area networks, and the Internet protocol suite, which defines a set of protocols
	  for internetworking, i.e. for data communication between multiple networks, as well as host-to-host data transfer, and
	  application-specific data transmission formats.
