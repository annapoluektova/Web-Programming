Let me introduce myself.
My name is Anna Poluektova.
I was born in Kemerovo, Russia.
My parents still live in Siberia, Russia.
My husband and I came to Toronto in 2010, so I have lived here for one and a half year.
I first education relates to Mathematics. 
n 2008, she graduated Kemerovo State University with a degree - Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
Starting from the 4th year I started working in the specialty.
At that time, I worked as a consultant for the accounting program in the city of Kemerovo.
Since I am a mathematician by training, to work with accounts I needed more knowledge on accounting.
For this, I took courses on the accounting.
After graduation, I worked for a company that does the install program to automate trading.
After immigrating to Canada, I started to study an ESL course at George Brown College.
Before I graduated an ESL course, I decided to continue my education, so I chose a specialization related to information technology because I am interested in working on the Computers.
Therefore, I took and passed an Admission Test, and now I am a Student of specialization T127: Computer Programmer Analyst, and I enjoy my studying.
